[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.2 - May 3, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to movies.  Please note
   TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list itmes per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this
    limit and to please wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in movies list to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb
   for better knowlege where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I may scrap all efforts on future TMDb developement as I'm not
   impressed with the rate limiter issue and honestly the lists are near identical to IMDb so what's
   the freakin point other than a cluttered interface?! Opionions welcome!  So it's not yieleding
   brownie points thus far with me, I had TVShows modded for TMDb list but said fuck this,
   as I felt all I was succeeding in doing was cluttering a clean interface with near identical lists
   sorry not what I was after and exo forks were not built around it so functionality sucks[/I]
