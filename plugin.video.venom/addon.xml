[[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.5 - May 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks. Extended artwork was causing
    a failure for some titles and list return was not the 20 items, TMDb provides, who's noticed?
    extended fanart was braking 1-2 titles per page.  That's resolved and each Movie page now
    yields 20 items from api response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb movies
   at this time and the results are more trustworthy, TV Shows next then onto IMDb. This
   allowed me to tweak the cache duration time to 6hrs without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] 4k fanart inclusion, previousely only 1920 width was allowed
   and lately many titles are 4k fanart only so this was a must change as I noticed the decrease
   in fanart in the interface. May cause a slight lag and considering adding a 4k fanart option
   to turtn this off. Downside is you will lose some if you turn it off so it's hard coded for now
   as always on[/I]
