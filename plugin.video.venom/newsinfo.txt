[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.5 - May 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks. Extended artwork was causing
    a failure for some titles and list return was not the 20 items, TMDb provides, who's noticed?
    extended fanart was braking 1-2 titles per page.  That's resolved and each Movie page now
    yields 20 items from api response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb movies
   at this time and the results are more trustworthy, TV Shows next then onto IMDb. This
   allowed me to tweak the cache duration time to 6hrs without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] 4k fanart inclusion, previousely only 1920 width was allowed
   and lately many titles are 4k fanart only so this was a must change as I noticed the decrease
   in fanart in the interface. May cause a slight lag and considering adding a 4k fanart option
   to turtn this off. Downside is you will lose some if you turn it off so it's hard coded for now
   as always on[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.4 - May 9, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few TMDb api fixes for missing meta.  Some genre and mpaa
   cases were dropped due to format issues. Some TV Shows runtime/duration returned more
   than one value so now we index just the first case and this stops seeing "0".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new request function to add a sleep/wait state for TMDB's
   api to limit the number of pop up notifications when rate-limiter is hit.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More code changes and soon the infamous worker() and
   super_info() functions will be gone.  They break as many list items as they create![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.3 - May 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to TV Shows.  Please note
   TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this
    limit and to please wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in TV Show lists to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb
   for better knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Dutch language choice to api[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed thread issue with large User/Watch lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb now has it's own py file and as I move towards separate files for
    indexing TMDb, Trakt, IMDb, and TVDb I have chosen to store these files in the "Indexers" folder.
   As a result all menu/navigation py files have been moved to a new "Menu" folder. Some old files were
   not removed in last update and this has now been corrected.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.2 - May 7, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to movies.  Please note
   TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this
    limit and to please wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in movies list to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb
   for better knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I may scrap all efforts on future TMDb development as I'm not
   impressed with the rate limiter issue and honestly the lists are near identical to IMDb so what's
   the freakin point other than a cluttered interface?! Opinions welcome!  So it's not yielding
   brownie points thus far with me.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.1 - May 3, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Now using Openscrapers for source providers!

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.0 - April 30, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

   reports Movie, Show, or Episode info if added to Trakt etc.  Also turned off
   annoying sounds for anything other than errors.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.9 - April 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Play" options.  Now when set to "Auto Play". Then
  context menu will have option called "Source Select" to override "AutoPlay",
  formerly "Play using..", made little sense what the function did.  Works in reverse
  if default play action is "Directory" you'll see "Auto Play"  as usual[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Queue Item" to "Add to Playlist" to better follow suit
  with new Playlist options coming soon[/I]
