[B][COLOR red]June 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] UpNext integration info.[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Please note this release requires the latest release of UpNext,    version 1.0.1, that can be found in the Kodi repo and was released on Jun 18, 2019. Version    1.0.0 has a few communication issues that were resolved in 1.0.1.  You will notice occasional    missing UpNext notifications with v1.0.0 so please be sure to check this.  Thank you Ian for    resolving this issue!![/I][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] For now the best way to use UpNext is with the Kodi context menu    option "Play from Here" or from within the "Playlist Manager" - "View Playlist"[/I][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Previously all exo forks refused to close the episode list items if    you used "Play from Here" so this play method for me became annoying.  I've fixed this and    episode list items, and playlist, now close. [/I][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Due to the above I was forced to hard code Auto Play for Episodes.    This was needed for the "Play from Here" context menu option to work in continual episode play    of an entire season.  If you select a single episode only that episode will play, but with Auto Play    still in effect.  If you disable UpNext this removes the hard code. If you wish to bypass Auto Play    for a single episode I suggest using the context menu option "Select Source" for the item you wish    to single play without Auto Play enabled[/I][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The Auto playlist creation is on by default and this is done behind    closed doors with no effect on performance at all.  You can try with and without this feature on    and you will not notice even the slightest difference so I suggest leaving it on.  At this time the    only thing this does is when you enter a Season the playlist will create a full episode list for the    given Season you entered only.  Entering the "Playlist Manager" you could view, edit,  and play    this list. Future plans for this playlist as well.[/I][COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The goal for next update is to get the playlist to play from a single    episode selection, so you won't have to use "Play from Here" but at this time I'm dealing with a    bit of a bug calling this playlist for direct play.  I also want to add a pre-scrape ability so next    episode play is instant without a visible scrape process, but timing it the scrape takes about    3-5secs for the next episode to play as it is now so I didn't holdback this release[/I]
